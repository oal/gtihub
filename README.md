### GTI Hub
Have you ever typed gtihub.com instead of github.com? Now you can get redirected with style!

Just add `212.47.247.209 gtihub.com` to your hosts file (/etc/hosts in a UNIX like OS and something like C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc in Windows).

Or serve it locally and point gtihub.com to localhost.
